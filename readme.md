# Reinforcement Learning projects

This repo contains multiple Reinforcement Learning projects trained with multiple approaches:
- A2C agent: training a pybullet agent with the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) algorithm.
- CartPole agent: training a CartPole agent with reinforce algorithm.
- Decision Transformer agent: training a Hopper agent with HuggingFace Decision Transformer agent
- DQN agent: training a space invador agent with DQN algorithm from RL-Baselines Zoo.
- Lunar Lander agent: training a lunar lander agent and hyperparemeter tuning with optuna.
- Frozen Lake agent: training a frozen lake agent with Q_learning algorithm implemented from scratch.
- Unity ML-agent: training a pyramids agent with Unity ML-agents.
